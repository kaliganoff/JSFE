My name is Nicholas or Nikolai in Russian and I'm a future junior Front-end developer.

Two and a half years ago I graduated from Leningrad State University as a Bachelor of Linguistics. From that point I was supposed to develop professionaly as a translator or an interpreter but I've never really liked translating written texts and finding a job as an interpreter is quite hard without experience.

I know Russian, English, German, some Spanish and Finnish. Recently I've been learning Japanese for fun. I could be teaching English now but I haven't tried being a language coach yet because I found a job being an online customer support specialist.

Which brings me to why I'm here. For a year now I've been working at my current job and I can't say it's very interesting. In fact, it's quite boring and repetitive. And also somehow stressful because a lot of times I have to consult four or five people at the same time. Needless to say, I can't imagine myself working that job for a long time. I think it would be quite soul crushing. So, I enrolled in the Rolling Scopes Front-End Course.

I've been aquainted with programming since school. At some point in middle school I read a book, I think it was called Programming for Dummies, and learnt basics of Liberty Basic. It's a very simple language and I wrote a program that could open wav  files and bpm images. It used built-in libraries so it wasn't hard to do this it all. Then in school we learnt some Pascal but it wasn't mandatory and I didn't write much in it.

So, now I want to become a Front-end developer and depending on how much I grow to like Node.js I might go Full-Stack. I like learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript because you solve interesting tasks and can see the results of your work. For example, at stage 0 we did a site of a library. It was very hard to build a working site for the first time but it felt very satisfying when everything looked and worked as it was supposed to in the end. You could register on the site and your data would be saved in localstorage. Then you could login and buy a library card. Using this card you could buy books and the books you bought would be saved in your profile. I learnt how to make modal windows, how to make an image slider and how to make custom radio buttons.

To conclude, I really hope that I can learn all the ins and outs of Front-end development and find an interesting and fulfilling job in IT. And good luck to everyone else with the same goal!
